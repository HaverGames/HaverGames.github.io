Chapter A : Children Privacy Policy
------
Chapter A  is our Children’s Privacy Policy and outlines how we handle personal data for children under 16 using our Children Apps or those indicating their age as under 16 at the age-gate. We collect personal information from children only as detailed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

Children must not provide personal information unless it's outlined in Section 3.3. If a child under your care has provided personal information, email us at havergames.nnnn@gmail.com for removal.

We collect information as described in Section 3 to support our internal operations in compliance with legal standards.

We engage Third Parties (like ad networks and analytics providers) to collect information passively but ensure they adhere to privacy laws, including the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
At the bottom of this page you can find a list of third parties that we work with along with links to their policies and links to optOut of their services.

An age-gate feature in our Apps is there to shield users under 16 from certain features, such as targeted advertising or data sharing.

Section 2 Offline use
-----
Children can use some features of our Children Apps offline, which prevents the collection of any information about the user by us or third parties.

Section 3 Online use
-----
There are 2 categories of data that we collected form our Children apps.

**Section 3.1 Non-personal Information:**

Our apps and third-party services may automatically gather anonymous information that doesn't reveal the child's identity. This includes technical data like the device type, operating system, session times, traffic sources, app interaction, ad responses, in-app purchases, gameplay statistics, app stability issues, and broad location (country level only).

**Section 3.2 Children’s Persistent Device Identifiers:**

We collect device identifiers like advertising IDs and user IDs to support the app's internal operations but do not collect personal information like names or addresses. IP addresses are kept for one week for error logs before deletion. We adhere to platform policies regarding the use of advertising identifiers.

**Purpose of Data Collection:**
The collected data is used exclusively for internal operations, such as:

- Enhancing and maintaining the apps
- Analyzing app performance
- Authenticating in-app purchases
- Personalizing user content
- Ensuring network communications
- Maintaining user and app security
- Delivering contextual ads and managing ad frequency
- Complying with legal or regulatory requirements
- Responding to user support inquiries

**Data Collection Methods:**
Data is collected via the app, including through third-party SDKs, and may be stored on the device using cookies-like technology. If third parties collect data from children, their privacy policies govern that process, but we ensure they comply with COPPA and our privacy standards.

**Non-Processing Access:**
Some apps may access personal and non-personal information for specific functionalities without Crazy Labs processing this data. For example, camera and microphone access for optional features like face manipulation, where content is stored locally and not transmitted to our servers.

**Section 4 Sharing Information with Third Parties**
------
Children Persistent Device Identifiers may be shared in specific scenarios, such as:

- Complying with legal requirements or government requests
- Enforcing policies or investigating policy violations
- Addressing fraud, security, or technical issues
- Protecting the rights or safety of the Company, users, or public
- During company transitions like mergers, acquisitions, or asset sales
- With a guardian's approval for providing requested services
- 
Children Non-personal Information may also be shared at the Company's discretion.

**Section 5 Advertising**
------
We display ads from third-party networks in our apps. These networks comply with privacy laws and COPPA. Clicking on ads takes users away from our apps, where the advertiser's cookies and tracking may collect information. We advise guardians to review these advertisers' privacy policies, as they, not ours, will govern those interactions. We may also advertise our apps on third-party platforms.

Chapter B: Cameo Games Hyper and Hybrid casual apps Privacy Policy
-------
Cameo Games Privacy Policy outlines our practices for handling personal data of users engaging with Crazy Labs Apps and those above 16 as confirmed through an age gate in our Children Apps. Apps in Chapter B refers to sections available solely to verified users over 16.

**Section 6 Data Processing**
------
This section describes the types of information we process from users that use our apps.

**Section 6.1 Non-Personal Information**
We, along with third-party service providers (like ad networks and analytics firms), may collect anonymous data that doesn’t reveal user identity. While this data is non-identifiable, some regions may regard it as personal information; see Section 20.2 for more on this.

**Section 6.2 Personal Information:**
Data that can identify users individually, which is considered private and sensitive.

Additionally, third parties might monitor and gather details of your online behavior across various digital services. For opting out of such tracking, consult Section 18.

It's important to note that if Non-Personal Information is linked to Personal Information, it will be treated as Personal Information.

We refrain from collecting any payment details, government IDs, private contacts, microphone and camera data, or sensitive device data from users.

Some Cameo Games Apps might access both Personal and Non-Personal Information for feature functionality, but this data isn't processed by Cameo Games—it stays on your device and isn't used or collected by us.
