Chapter A : Children Privacy Policy

Chapter A  is our Children’s Privacy Policy and outlines how we handle personal data for children under 16 using our Children Apps or those indicating their age as under 16 at the age-gate. We collect personal information from children only as detailed in Sections 3.2 and 3.3.

Children must not provide personal information unless it's outlined in Section 3.3. If a child under your care has provided personal information, email us at havergames.nnnn@gmail.com for removal.

We collect information as described in Section 3 to support our internal operations in compliance with legal standards.

We engage Third Parties (like ad networks and analytics providers) to collect information passively but ensure they adhere to privacy laws, including the US Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). 
At the bottom of this page you can find a list of third parties that we work with along with links to their policies and links to optOut of their services.

An age-gate feature in our Apps is there to shield users under 16 from certain features, such as targeted advertising or data sharing.
